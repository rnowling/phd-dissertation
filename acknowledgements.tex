  During the journey towards earning my Ph.D., I learned that a Ph.D. is not the work of one person alone but rather requires the support of an entire community. I am incredibly grateful and appreciative of the support that many have provided, both directly in helping me successfully complete my Ph.D. and helping me along the path towards a Ph.D. in the first place.

  First, I want to thank my family.  My grandmother Dr. Mary Ellen Jacobs, who earned her Ph.D. later in life after a successful first career as a musician, has always encouraged my intellectual pursuits, inspired me to pursue a Ph.D., opened doors to a position at UConn that started my research career, and provided an empthatic ear as someone who has walked the Ph.D. path before me.  My mother Erika Tracy has always enthusiastically supported (and helped finance!) my educational and scholarly pursuits -- I will be forever grateful of her embrace of my work and trust in my ability to set my own path. My grandfather James Jacobs was always ready with sound advice on people and character, which helped me grow as a person.  My fianc\'{e}e Marissa McCabe has stood by my side and been incredibly flexible while I've been working full time and working on my Ph.D. part-time over the last two years.
  
  My Ph.D. advisors, Profs. Scott Emrich and Mary Ann McDowell, took a risk when they placed their trust in me to finish my Ph.D. while working full time.
