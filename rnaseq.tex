\textcolor{red}{TODO Cuffdiff}

Gene identifiers for genes marked as statistically significant by \texttt{CuffDiff} were extracted for each time point and feeding condition.  The corresponding protein sequences for each gene were extracted from the genomes.  The protein sequences were merged and run through \texttt{BLAST2GO}. \textcolor{red}{TODO CITE, VERSION}
